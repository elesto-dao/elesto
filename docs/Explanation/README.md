## Introduction

This section contains **Explanation documentation** for Elesto. This content is intended to help readers **understand Elesto and related topics**. It is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting, and occasionally educational. The content includes analysis and review of alternative approaches. 

Please see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) for further background information.

## Layout

The scope and structure of the Explanation documentation follow this layout.

### Topics

Topics are discursive documents that explore some particular feature or theme.  For example, an article might investigate Decentralised Identity Documents or Self-Sovereign Identity.

To contribute, create a folder in [topics](./topics) with a self-descriptive name. Add your content as needed.

### Presentations

The [Presentations](presentations.md) file describes and links to presentations about Elesto at various events. Presentations also include YouTube videos,  podcasts, interviews, and so on. 


### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for contributors to raise design proposals. In turn, the ADRs explain the rationale behind Elesto design and implementation for subsequent contributors. For example, [ADR 002: Documentation Structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) explains why the Elesto documentation structure was chosen. 

See the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) [README](./ADR/README.md) file for more details about raising and proposing an ADR.

### Articles

This folder contains all articles relating to Elesto, includes papers, blog posts, etc. For details, see [Articles README](articles/README.md).


## Discussions

The explanation content includes articles, topics, and so on, and also includes discussion on relevant channels, including [Pull Requests](https://github.com/elesto-dao/elesto/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/elesto-dao/elesto/issues). Important Pull Requests are listed in this document.
