# Architecture

## Overview

Architecture documentation is based on [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), which comes with many documentation and examples. Diagrams are created through text-based documents (`.puml` files) that are then rendered into an appropriate format like Pandoc Markdown to generate PDFs and HTML output.

PlantUML was chosen as the architecture medium for several reasons, of which the most important are:

1. It supports several different types of diagrams: class, sequence, activity, ERM ...
2. Diagrams can be stored with the codebase and documentation instead in a separate system such as Whimsical and then imported as needed into documentation.
