## Commits messages

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) format for commit messages and implements it through the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework. You must install and enable pre-commit before you can contribute to the project. 


## Pull Request Process

1. To install and enable the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework, run the `pre-commit install` command.
2. Update the project README.md with details of interface changes, including new or changed environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Pull Requests can be merged after they have approvals of one other developer. 
   If you do not have merge permissions, request the second reviewer to merge the PR for you.
